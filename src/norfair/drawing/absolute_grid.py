    Parameters
    ----------
    frame : np.ndarray
        The OpenCV frame to draw on.
    coord_transformations : CoordinatesTransformation
        The coordinate transformation as returned by the [`MotionEstimator`][norfair.camera_motion.MotionEstimator]
    grid_size : int, optional

    radius : int, optional
        Size of each point.
    thickness : int, optional
        Thickness of each point
    color : ColorType, optional
        Color of the points.
    polar : Bool, optional
        If True, the points on the first frame are drawn as if the camera were pointing to a pole (viewed from the center of the earth).
        By default, False is used which means the points are drawn as if the camera were pointing to the Equator.
